## About me

All my adult life I spend at the computer. Therefore, working in the IT field has become my main goal. This is why I entered in RSS courses. The profession of a Front-end developer looks very interesting and exciting. I am purposeful, sociable and quick to learn. I think these skills are enough to complete the courses and become a good specialist.

## Skills

HTML5 - ★★  
CSS - ★★  
JAVASCRIPT - ★★★

## Example code

As an example code, I'm using a solution to a task on Codewars 'Does my number look big in this?' 6 kyu JavaScript:

```JavaScript
function narcissistic(value) {
let arr = value.toString().split('')
let pow = arr.length
let mult = 0
let sum = 0
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
  mult = arr[i] ** pow
  sum += mult
}
 return sum === value ? true : false
}
```
